  "A Neural Network is a computer program that operates similarly to the human brain. The objective of neural networks is to perform those cognitive functions our brain can perform like problem-solving and being teachable. The primary appeal of neural networks is their ability to emulate the brainâ€™s pattern-recognition skills. Among personal and commercial applications of neural networks, they have been used for a wide array of things like they have been used to predict the outcome of investment decisions, they can find patterns in handwriting and they can even scan land areas for anomalies which makes it able to point out things like land mines or bombs.";
