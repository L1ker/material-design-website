# Material-Design Website using React
This repository is my simple frontend for a website about machine learning. <br>
Text and Videos are included and work.
## Additional Info
This is my first `React.js` project I did earlier this year. <br>
I used `create-react-app` to setup my working environment. <br>
For UI I used the `material-ui library` for React. <br>
Testing was done via node on localhost.
